# Dashboard-for-Earthquake-Analysis
Developed a Data visualization dashboard for analysis of earthquakes around the world since 1900, using a flourish tool to extract the required key metrics for analysis. Designed a website for reporting the analysis results

Below is the link to the Google sites website where I have added the Data visualization dashboard for analysis of earthquakes around the world since 1900. I used the flourish tool to extract the key metrics such as number and locations of earthquakes in a interactive map chart between the years 1900 to 2023, The hotspots of earthquakes, Earthquake occurances across continents (1995 - 2023), Correlation Analysis between Seismic Station Quantity and Proximity to Epicenter, earthquake magnitude Vs. Depth of the quake, and top 10 Deadliest earthquakes by death toll, 21st century.

Adding below some sources from where I extracted the data for my visualizations
